# Interview-Questions
This repository contains interview questions I have found either from:
  - Cracking the Coding Interview
  - Hacker Rank
  - Actual interviews
  
   ### About
   I have decided to write these programming problems using:
   -C or C++
   -Google Test Framework  * [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
   -Visual Studio IDE
   
  I have opted to use C and C++ as my main two programming languages when solving these problems. The reason I have chosen C++ over
  some problems instead of C is due to some questions are best solved using object-oriented principles. I find writing C++ to be much easier although even
  when I use C++ I keep in mind it is still preferred in most embedded applications to use C. Therefore the problems that
  can be solved very easily in C++ may seem to be more tedious as I tend to try to not use things like std::string and its 
  corresponding functions although may have used it in some cases especially the actual timed interviews where this was allowed.
  
  I am using the Google Test Framework because it is easy to use in my IDE of choice, Visual Studio. Visual Studio is easy to use and I have experience using it from college.
  
  ### Why
  I have decided to share my code in order for recruiters and other engineers to see my style. All of the code here is written by me
  and I do not give permission for anyone to copy.
  
   #### Contact
   I am currently looking for a full-time role in the embedded software or related fields. If you have any suggestions or think that I would be a good contributor to a project at a company please feel free to contact me.
