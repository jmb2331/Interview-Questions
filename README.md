# Interview-Questions
This repository contains interview questions I have found either from:
  - Cracking the Coding Interview
  - Hacker Rank
  - Actual interviews
  
  ### Why
  I have decided to share my code in order for recruiters and other engineers to see my style. All of the code here is written by me
  and I do not give permission for anyone to copy.
  
  ### About
  I have opted to use C and C++ as my main two programming languages when solving these problems. The reason I have chosen C++ over
  some problems instead of C is due to the Object-Oriented nature of C++. I find writing C++ to be much easier although even
  when I use C++ I keep in mind it is still preferred in most embedded applications to use C. Therefore the problems that
  can be solved very easily in C++ may seem to be more tedious as I tend to try to not use things like std::string and its 
  corresponding functions although may have used it in some cases especially the actual timed interviews where this was allowed.
