# Interview-Questions
This repository contains interview questions I have found either from:
  - [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)
  - [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
  - Actual interviews
 
  
   ### About
   I have decided to write these programming problems using:
   - [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) or [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
   - [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)
   - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
   
   
  I have opted to use C and C++ as my main two programming languages when solving these problems. The reason I have chosen C++ over
  some problems instead of C is due to some questions are best solved using object-oriented principles. I find writing C++ to be much easier although even
  when I use C++ I keep in mind it is still preferred in most embedded applications to use C. Therefore the problems that
  can be solved very easily in C++ may seem to be more tedious as I tend to try to not use things like std::string and its 
  corresponding functions although may have used it in some cases especially the actual timed interviews where this was allowed.
  
  I am using the Google Test Framework because it is easy to use in my IDE of choice, Visual Studio. This testing framework is well documented and I recommend it to anyone that would like to write tests for their code. I ahve used other testing frameworks in the past,however I find it much easier to add Google Test in Visual Studios' Package Manager.
  
 > Note: upon making this repository, I have switched to soley use the Linux distribution [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) . Therefore I will be switching from Visual Studio to possibly just compiling my code via terminal using a compiler such as [g++](https://www.cprogramming.com/g++.html) ...
  
  ### Why
  I have decided to share my code in order for recruiters and other engineers to see my style. All of the code here is written by me
  and I do not give permission for anyone to copy.
  
  #### Goals
   My goal of this repository is to share my progression as a programmer and to have a nice way of looking back at my code that can be easily pulled.
  
   #### Contact
   I am currently looking for a full-time role in the embedded software or related fields. If you have any suggestions or think that I would be a good contributor to a project at a company please feel free to contact me.
